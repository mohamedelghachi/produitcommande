## Project Structure

This **Node.js** project utilizes *Express.js* to build a multi-service application. It consists of two distinct services:

- **_Product Service_**: Manages product data, offering APIs to create and retrieve product information.

- **_Command Service_**: Facilitates command creation and retrieval, involving product information. It interacts with the product service to fetch necessary details.

Both services leverage **MongoDB** for data persistence.
